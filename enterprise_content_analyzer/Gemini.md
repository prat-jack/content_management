## Task Summary

I have created a `ContentAnalyzer` class that connects to the OpenAI API, analyzes content using `gpt-4o-mini`, and returns a structured analysis including a summary, sentiment, and key points. This new class is integrated into the existing Streamlit application, and the frontend has been updated to display the new analysis format. Error handling and the use of environment variables for the API key are also included.
